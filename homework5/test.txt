Flowers for Algeron
Summary
Chapter 1
Charlie Gordon is a mentally retarded man of thirty-seven. On March 5, 1956, on the advice of Dr. Strauss, he begins to keep a diary in which he must write down everything that he thinks and what happens to him.
Chapter 2
Charlie had a test the next day. A scientist came to him, who "had a few white cards and they were all filled with ink." The scientist asked Charlie what he sees on the cards, but he replied that nothing but the usual blots.
Chapter 3
Charlie told Dr. Strauss and Dr. Remur that he attended an adult school. He "wanted all his life to be smart, not dumb," and Mrs. Kinnian, a teacher, praised him for diligence and thirst for knowledge. Charlie was introduced to a white mouse named Algernon, who also participated in the experiment. Charlie and Algernon took quick wit tests together, and the mouse invariably won.
Chapter 4
Charlie volunteered for an operation to improve his intelligence. He was very pleased that Dr. Strauss and Dr. Remur chose him and promised "horror as an old man."
Chapter 5
On the eve of the operation, Charlie began to be overcome with fear, but the desire to become smart and defeat Algernon's mouse turned out to be stronger than all his worries.
Chapter 6
When the blindfold was removed from Charlie's head and eyes, Dr. Strauss told him to start journaling again, while writing more about what he thought and felt. However, it is difficult for Charlie to fulfill this condition: he does not know how to think and wants to get smarter as soon as possible.
Chapter 7
Charlie went through "many trials and various contests with Algernon." By that time, he already hated the mouse, which constantly beat him.
Chapter 8
Charlie returned to the factory again, where he worked as a janitor. But he must not tell anyone about the operation, and every day he must appear in the hospital for examination. Learning that Algernon constantly beats him only because he, too, had a similar operation, Charlie cheered up: he had a real hope that he would grow wiser. Charlie was visited by Dr. Strauss, who brought him a "TV" - a device that should work during sleep. In addition, now Mrs. Kinnian will teach him individually, under the supervision of doctors.
Chapter 9
Charlie went to the party with his colleagues Joe Kerp and Frank Reilly. He sincerely considered them his friends, but the men only laughed at the weak-minded Charlie. During the competition, Charlie began to defeat Algernon and soon became friends with him. He also began to read, his literacy improved. Mrs. Kinnian was very pleased with her student's progress. She believed that Charlie had "done more than a lot of smart people who never even use their brains."
Chapter 10
Charlie grew wiser enough to realize that he was nothing but a laughingstock to his so-called friends. He began to study history, geography, arithmetic, foreign languages. In addition, Charlie fell in love with Alice Kinnian.
Chapter 11
An astonishingly fast-growing intellect put up a wall between Charlie and his old acquaintances. It even became obvious to him the limitations of Dr. Strauss and Dr. Nemur, their errors in the experiment. He could not find a common language with Alice either.
Chapter 12
When the mouse began to show signs of regression, Charlie decided to come to grips with this scientific issue. However, he did not have time: his intellect was fading as quickly as it had evolved. Charlie returned to his old job at the factory, and his former comrades no longer made fun of him as before. Returning to his original mental state, Charlie did not regret anything, because he used his chance to become smart and learn many new interesting things.
And what is the result?
Charlie Gordon - His intelligence is rapidly fading, and he returns to his original mental state, works in a factory again, and then leaves for another city.
Alice Kinnian - continues to work at a school for special adults.
